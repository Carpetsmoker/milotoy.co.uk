excerpt: "**Exhibiting & winning highly commended beating the other 20 bip finalists**


With 80,000 people visiting the show over the four day exhibition it was an excellent opportunity to show the public a first glimpse of Milo.


And what a response we received!"

We were invited to this year’s Gadget Show Live at the NEC in Birmingham. Milo
was exhibited as part of the British Inventor’s Project (BIP) which aims to
celebrate innovation and showcase new and fledgling ideas. The project has been
running since 2014 and has only been growing in strength.

We won our spot at the Gadget Show Live after pitching to 8 toy companies at the
Toy News Inventor’s Workshop last year. I had about 10 minutes to pitch to the
professionals in a Dragon’s Den style event. It was a nerve-wracking but
rewarding experience as Milo was first shown off to the toy industry

Over the course of the four-day event an expected 80,000 people would attend
making it the biggest opportunity to present Milo to the public so far. After 5
months travelling, arriving in the UK only days before the show, time was a
little tight to get all the prep done ready for the show – perhaps a lesson
learnt for the next event!

Even so I made the print deadline after a hectic few days of jetlag, Illustrator
and mild panic. The Milo brand was taking shape and all that remained was to
make sure Milo himself was prepared for his big day on show. A few weeks before
the event he’d had a little high impact accident with kitchen tiles and it’s
safe to say he suffered quite a bit from the fall. Subsequently the two days
prior to the show were spent delicately applying glue, tape or blue tack
(whatever would do the job) in strategic locations before touching up with a
little paint. Call it the Milo hospital or something because once it was done
Milo was a little weak but ready for his debut on the whole.

The day before doors open to the public the 20 BIP finalists were invited to the
NEC to set up. On first sighting the hall was huge. I’d been to the NEC before
but had never seen a show in mid set up – without products or people the size
was only amplified. Making our way through the maze of semi unrolled carpet
carpet we found the Milo stand and took our first glimpse at our spot. Luckily
I’d been allocated a stand on the end of a row meaning I would only have 2 walls
instead of 3. This was great as it gave me much more visibility from both
neighbouring walkways and made me space feel much bigger.
